## Technical Integration Patterns

### Multi-Framework Deployment Architectures

**1. Serial Processing Pattern**
```
Input → Framework A → Framework B → Framework C → Output
```
- **Use Case**: Layered protection with specialized filtering
- **Advantages**: Comprehensive coverage, audit trail
- **Disadvantages**: Cumulative latency, potential cascade failures
- **Example**: Input filtering with Llama Guard → Output validation with NeMo

**2. Parallel Evaluation Pattern**
```
           ┌─ Framework A ─┐
Input ────┤─ Framework B ─├─→ Consensus Engine → Output
           └─ Framework C ─┘
```
- **Use Case**: High-confidence decisions with redundancy
- **Advantages**: Fault tolerance, reduced false positives
- **Disadvantages**: Higher computational cost, consensus complexity
- **Example**: Multiple frameworks voting on content safety

**3. Hybrid Orchestration Pattern**
```
Input → Cloud Service (Azure) → On-Premise (NeMo) → Domain-Specific (Custom) → Output
```
- **Use Case**: Balancing cost, latency, and specialized requirements
- **Advantages**: Optimized resource utilization, regulatory compliance
- **Disadvantages**: Complex orchestration, multiple failure points

### Integration Challenges and Solutions

**Standardization Gaps:**
- **Problem**: Each framework uses different input/output formats
- **Solution**: Implement adapter layers with standard message schemas
- **Example**: JSON normalization layer between Azure API and NeMo toolkit

**Authentication Complexity:**
- **Problem**: Cloud-specific authentication methods complicate hybrid deployments
- **Solution**: Unified credential management with service account abstraction
- **Implementation**: OAuth2 proxy for cloud services, certificate-based for on-premise

**Rate Limiting Coordination:**
- **Problem**: Different rate limiting policies across providers
- **Solution**: Intelligent request distribution with fallback mechanisms
- **Strategy**: Priority queuing with automatic provider switching

## Implementation Best Practices

### Design Principles

**1. Fail-Safe Defaults**
- Default to most restrictive policy when frameworks disagree
- Implement circuit breakers for framework unavailability
- Maintain offline backup rules for critical path operations

**2. Performance Optimization**
- Cache frequently accessed policies and models
- Implement intelligent routing based on content type
- Use asynchronous processing where real-time response isn't required

**3. Monitoring and Observability**
- Centralized logging across all framework integrations
- Performance metrics for each framework and integration pattern
- Alerting for availability, latency, and accuracy degradation

### Configuration Management

**Environment-Specific Configurations:**
```yaml
production:
  primary_framework: "nemo_guardrails"
  fallback_chain: ["azure_safety", "llama_guard"]
  parallel_processing: false
  latency_threshold: 500ms
  
staging:
  primary_framework: "azure_safety"
  parallel_processing: true
  testing_frameworks: ["guardrails_ai", "custom_models"]
  
development:
  framework_rotation: true
  comprehensive_logging: true
  testing_mode: true
```

### Error Handling Strategies

**Framework Unavailability:**
1. **Primary Failure**: Automatic failover to configured backup
2. **Multiple Failures**: Graceful degradation with rule-based filtering
3. **Complete Failure**: Block all content until manual intervention

**Consensus Conflicts:**
1. **Voting Mechanism**: Majority rule with confidence weighting
2. **Tie Breaking**: Default to most restrictive framework decision
3. **Human Escalation**: Flag ambiguous cases for manual review
