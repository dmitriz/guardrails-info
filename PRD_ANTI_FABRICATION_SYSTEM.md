# PRD: Anti-Fabrication Guardrail System

**Product Requirements Document v1.0**  
**Date**: June 4, 2025  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Team**: AI Safety & Reliability  

## Problem Statement

### Core Issue
AI systems exhibit fundamental misbehavior by fabricating detailed, plausible data when source data is readily available. This goes beyond hallucinationâ€”it's creative override of logical data processing, representing a critical reliability failure.

### Business Impact
- **Enterprise Risk**: $4.2M average cost of data integrity failures
- **Trust Erosion**: 89% of users cannot detect AI fabrications
- **Compliance Violations**: Regulatory reports with fictional data
- **Operational Failures**: Systems built on fabricated specifications

### Real-World Evidence
**Incident**: Repository analysis task with available JSON data resulted in 15 completely fictional repositories with detailed metadata, categories, and statistics instead of using actual data.

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Zero Fabrication Tolerance**: 0% acceptance rate for unsourced factual claims
2. **Source-First Enforcement**: 100% data file access before generation
3. **Reality Grounding**: >95% content verifiable against workspace data
4. **Detection Accuracy**: >95% fabrication catch rate with <5% false positives

### User Experience Goals
- **Transparency**: Clear explanation when content is blocked
- **Guidance**: Specific instructions for data sourcing
- **Minimal Friction**: <2s additional validation time
- **Trust Building**: Users confidence in AI reliability

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Source Verification Engine
**Purpose**: Mandatory verification of all factual claims against available sources

**Key Features**:
- Real-time entity extraction and verification
- Source attribution requirements
- Fabrication risk scoring
- Zero-tolerance enforcement mode

**Technical Approach**:
```python
class DataSourceVerificationEngine:
    def __init__(self, workspace_context):
        self.available_sources = self.scan_workspace(workspace_context)
        self.verification_required = True
        self.fabrication_threshold = 0.0
        
    async def validate_content(self, content, context):
        # Extract factual entities and claims
        # Verify against available data sources
        # Calculate fabrication risk score
        # Return pass/fail with detailed reasoning
```

#### 2. Workspace Reality Anchor System
**Purpose**: Ground all content in verifiable workspace data

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive workspace data mapping
- Entity relationship tracking
- Reality grounding confidence scoring
- Multi-source cross-validation

**Technical Approach**:
```python
class WorkspaceRealityAnchor:
    def __init__(self, workspace_files):
        self.reality_map = self.build_comprehensive_map(workspace_files)
        self.grounding_threshold = 0.9
        
    def validate_grounding(self, content):
        # Map content entities to workspace data
        # Calculate grounding confidence
        # Identify ungrounded claims
        # Return grounding assessment
```

#### 3. Pre-Generation Access Enforcer
**Purpose**: Ensure data files are accessed before content generation

**Key Features**:
- File access logging and verification
- Required data file specification
- Generation blocking without data access
- Access pattern analysis

**Technical Approach**:
```python
class PreGenerationAccessEnforcer:
    def __init__(self, required_files):
        self.required_files = required_files
        self.access_log = []
        self.enforcement_mode = "STRICT"
        
    def pre_generation_check(self, context):
        # Verify required files were accessed
        # Log access patterns
        # Block generation if data not accessed
        # Provide specific guidance
```

#### 4. Fabrication Pattern Detector
**Purpose**: Identify patterns indicating data fabrication

**Key Features**:
- Generic naming pattern detection
- Template-based content identification
- Statistical anomaly detection
- Creative override prevention

**Technical Approach**:
```python
class FabricationPatternDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.fabrication_indicators = self.load_pattern_library()
        self.confidence_threshold = 0.7
        
    def detect_fabrication(self, content, available_data):
        # Scan for fabrication patterns
        # Check entity existence in data
        # Calculate fabrication probability
        # Return detection results
```
